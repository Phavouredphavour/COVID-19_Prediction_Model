# PREDICTIVE MODELLING FOR COVID-19 IN PUBLIC HEALTH

## Project Overview 
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions globally, and understanding the trends in infection rates is crucial for managing public health interventions. This project aims to analyse COVID-19 case data and develop predictive models to forecast future trends and identify high-risk regions.
## Procedure 
* Data Cleaning: the dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency and quality.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was carried out to understand the distribution of the data, identifying trends, and spotting anomalies.
* Model Development: Time-series forecasting was performed using Prophet, an open-source forecasting tool by Facebook.
* Model Evaluation: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) was used for the time-series forecasting model to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
## Key Insights and Public Health Implications
* Countries with rapid increases in confirmed cases were identified.
* Identification of regions with high mortality rates, which could indicate overwhelmed healthcare systems.
## Summary of Findings
* The data analysis revealed countries with alarming growth rates and high mortality ratios.
* Time-series forecasting showed potential for predicting COVID-19 trends, although accuracy diminishes with longer forecasts.
* The Random Forest Classifier provided useful classification of high-risk countries, aiding public health decision-making.
